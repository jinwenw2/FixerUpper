<!--
	The first thing I did was reorganize the lines so that the code was more readable.
	I got rid of all of the blank spaces before indenting properly under the <ul> tag.
	I also made sure to indent <li> under <ul> because <li> is a child under <ul>
	<h3> was missing a </h3> so I added that too.
	</meta> is also not needed.
