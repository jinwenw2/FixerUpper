<!--
  The first thing I did was to try and fix the formatting which made the code a lot more readable.
  I got rid of most of the blank spaces between the tags first.
  /p> is missing a < at the beginning so I changed that to </p>.
  <html> at the bottom was changed to </html>
  <img> does not need </img> at the end so I removed </img>.
  divv was changed to div.
