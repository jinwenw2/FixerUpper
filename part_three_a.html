<!--
    I first changed </hh3> to </h3> because that is a clear misspelling.
    There was an extra </div> so I deleted that too.
    The <img> tag also consintently had </img> at the end so I deleted those too.
    The <ul> tag at the bottom was missing a / so I changed it to </ul>.
    <li was also missing a > so I changed it to <li>.
    This code was a lot harder to debug without fixing th formatting because it made it very hard to read.
