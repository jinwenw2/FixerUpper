<!--
	Like part a, I started by removing many of the blank spaces to improve the readability of the code.
	I then reformatted the code.
	</div was missing a > at the end so I added that in.
	The </img> tag isn't needed at the end of <img> so I removed those too.
	The <li> in Option Three was missing so I also added that in.
	<html> at the bottom was missing a / so I changed it to </html>
